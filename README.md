# React + Vite

Problem Statement:

Your challenge is to build out a minimal note taking app.

Features List:

-> User should be able to create group for notes, a popup open up to create a new group and user can choose a color for the group. If the user clicks outside the popup then you need to close the popup.

-> User should be able to add notes in a particular group. Along with notes you need to show the note creation date and time.

-> User should be able save the note by clicking on the Send icon in the text input area, and if no text is present then the Send icon should be disabled

You need to save the notes in localstorage, every notes and group should persist on page reload/ refresh.

-> As soon as the user changes the group, you need to fetch all the notes related to that particular group

-> You will need to create both desktop and mobile responsive design for the assignment

-> You need to add all kinds of validation checks and error handling related to group and notes

-> Apart from these, you must follow all the instructions mentioned in the Figma design page as well

-> Your output should look exactly the same like the Figma designed pages

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
